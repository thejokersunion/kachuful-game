# Kachuful (Judgement) Card Game - Complete Rules & Specifications

## Game Overview

**Kachuful** (also known as **Judgement** or **Oh Hell!**) is a trick-taking card game where players bid on the exact number of tricks they will win each round. The unique challenge is that you must win exactly the number of tricks you bid - no more, no less.

### Game Objective
Score the most points by accurately predicting the number of tricks you'll win in each round. Winning too many or too few tricks results in penalties.

### Initial Setup

## Game Flow

### Round Structure

The game consists of multiple rounds, with the number of cards dealt varying each round:

#### Ascending Phase
- **Round 1**: 1 card per player
- **Round 2**: 2 cards per player
- **Round 3**: 3 cards per player
- Continue until reaching maximum cards (depends on player count)

#### Maximum Cards
- **3 players**: Up to 17 cards
- **4 players**: Up to 13 cards
- **5 players**: Up to 10 cards
- **6 players**: Up to 8 cards
- **7 players**: Up to 7 cards

#### Descending Phase (Optional)
After reaching maximum, rounds descend back to 1 card
- If ascending to 10 cards: 10 → 9 → 8 → ... → 1

### Complete Round Sequence

Each round consists of 5 phases:

#### 1. Deal Phase
- Dealer distributes cards clockwise
- Each player receives the same number of cards based on the round
- Remaining cards form the stock pile

#### 2. Trump Selection Phase
- **Top card of stock is flipped** to reveal trump suit
- If no cards remain in stock (maximum round), there is **No Trump**
- Trump suit beats all other suits during trick-taking

#### 3. Bidding Phase
- Starting from dealer's left, each player bids on tricks they'll win
- Bids range from **0 (nil)** to **maximum cards in round**
- **Special Rule**: The last bidder (dealer) cannot bid such that the total bids equal the number of tricks available
  - Example: In a 5-card round with 4 players, if first 3 players bid 2, 1, and 1 (total 4), dealer cannot bid 1 (which would make total = 5)
- Bids are recorded and visible to all players

#### 4. Trick-Taking Phase
- Player to dealer's left leads the first trick
- Players must **follow suit** if possible
- If cannot follow suit, may play any card (including trump)
- **Highest trump wins** the trick; if no trump, **highest card of led suit** wins
- Winner of each trick leads the next trick
- Continue until all cards are played

#### 5. Scoring Phase
- Compare actual tricks won vs bid
- Calculate and award points
- Update player scores

## Detailed Rules

### Trump Suit
- **Trump cards beat all non-trump cards** regardless of rank
- Among trump cards, higher rank wins
- If no trump is played in a trick, highest card of led suit wins
- **No Trump rounds**: When stock pile is empty (maximum card rounds), no suit is trump

### Following Suit
- Players **must** play a card of the led suit if they have one
- Only if they have no cards of the led suit can they play:
  - A trump card (to try to win)
  - Any other card (to discard)

### Winning Tricks
**Priority order:**
1. Highest trump card (if any trump played)
2. Highest card of led suit (if no trump played)

**Examples:**
- Led suit: Hearts, Trump: Spades
  - Player 1: 10♥, Player 2: K♥, Player 3: 2♠, Player 4: A♥
  - Winner: Player 3 (trump beats all)
  
- Led suit: Clubs, Trump: Diamonds (no trump played)
  - Player 1: 5♣, Player 2: K♣, Player 3: 9♥, Player 4: Q♣
  - Winner: Player 2 (highest of led suit)

### Nil Bids (Bidding Zero)
- Player predicts they will win **no tricks**
- Often a strategic choice in rounds with many cards
- Risk: Even one accidental trick loses points

## Scoring System

### Standard Scoring

#### Successful Bid (Made Contract)
**Points = 10 + (Bid × 5)**

Examples:
- Bid 0, won 0: **10 points**
- Bid 1, won 1: **15 points** (10 + 1×5)
- Bid 3, won 3: **25 points** (10 + 3×5)
- Bid 5, won 5: **35 points** (10 + 5×5)

#### Failed Bid (Broke Contract)
**Points = -(|Actual - Bid| × 5)**

The penalty is 5 points for each trick over or under the bid.

Examples:
- Bid 2, won 1: **-5 points** (|1-2| × 5)
- Bid 2, won 3: **-5 points** (|3-2| × 5)
- Bid 1, won 3: **-10 points** (|3-1| × 5)
- Bid 4, won 1: **-15 points** (|1-4| × 5)
- Bid 0, won 1: **-5 points** (failed nil)

### Alternative Scoring (Optional Variants)

#### Variant 1: Simple Scoring
- **Made bid**: Bid × 10 points
- **Failed bid**: -(Difference × 10) points

#### Variant 2: Nil Bonus
- **Successful nil bid**: 20 points (bonus)
- **Failed nil bid**: -20 points (harsh penalty)

## Strategy Tips

### General Strategy
1. **Count trump cards**: Track how many trumps are out
2. **Remember bids**: Know what others need
3. **Control your fate**: Don't accidentally win/lose tricks
4. **Void suits**: Intentionally run out of a suit to control tricks

### Bidding Strategy
- **Early rounds (1-3 cards)**: More predictable, bid confidently
- **Middle rounds (4-8 cards)**: Moderate risk
- **Late rounds (9+ cards)**: Higher uncertainty, bid conservatively
- **High cards and trump**: Count your likely winners
- **Low cards**: Harder to control, bid cautiously

### Playing Strategy
- **Above your bid**: Play high cards to win tricks
- **At your bid**: Play defensively to avoid extra tricks
- **Below your bid**: Play low cards, let others win

### Advanced Tactics
1. **Dealer's Restriction**: Use it strategically when you're dealer
2. **Last to Play**: Advantage in controlling trick outcomes
3. **Trump Management**: Save trump for critical moments
4. **Sandbagging**: Play just high enough to avoid winning unwanted tricks

---

## Game End

### Winning Conditions
- Game ends after all rounds are completed (ascending and descending)
- Player with the **highest total score** wins
- Ties are possible (shared victory or play tiebreaker round)

### Typical Game Length
- **3-4 players**: 30-45 minutes
- **5-7 players**: 45-60 minutes

---

## Variations & House Rules

### Common Variations

1. **No Trump First Round**: First round always has no trump
2. **Fixed Number of Rounds**: Play only ascending or only 10 rounds
3. **Blind Nil**: Bid nil before looking at cards (double points/penalty)
4. **Hidden Bids**: Bids revealed simultaneously after all players decide
5. **Dealer's Advantage**: Dealer always bids last but without restriction

### Regional Variants
- **American "Oh Hell!"**: Often uses different scoring
- **British "Nomination Whist"**: Similar but with partnership options
- **European "Diminishing Whist"**: Only descending rounds

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Game State Management
```typescript
interface GameState {
  roundNumber: number
  phase: 'deal' | 'trump' | 'bidding' | 'playing' | 'scoring'
  players: Player[]
  deck: Card[]
  trumpSuit: Suit | null
  currentTrick: Card[]
  trickWinner: string | null
  bids: { [playerId: string]: number }
  tricksWon: { [playerId: string]: number }
  scores: { [playerId: string]: number }
  currentPlayer: string
  dealer: string
}
```

### Key Functions Needed
- `dealCards()`: Distribute cards for round
- `selectTrump()`: Flip trump card
- `placeBid()`: Record player bid with validation
- `playCard()`: Validate and play card
- `evaluateTrick()`: Determine trick winner
- `calculateScore()`: Apply scoring rules
- `advanceRound()`: Move to next round
- `checkGameEnd()`: Determine if game is complete

### Validation Logic
- **Card legality**: Must follow suit if possible
- **Bid legality**: Dealer restriction
- **Turn order**: Enforce correct player sequence
- **Game rules**: All standard rules enforced

---

## Quick Reference

### Card Hierarchy
**Trump Suit > Led Suit > Other Suits**

**Rank**: A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2

### Scoring Formula
- **Success**: 10 + (Bid × 5)
- **Failure**: -(|Difference| × 5)

### Round Progression
